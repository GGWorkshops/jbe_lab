Megan Corletti, This work is mine unless otherwise cited.

Some JVM commands within the byte code that were different for doubles consisted
of ldc2_w and dstore. ldc2_w operates by pushing long or double from run-time
constant pool. dstore stores double variables into a local constant. Within the
Java file, I left the numbers as they were but labeled them as doubles. When
compiling the Java file, the numbers printed out as decimals and the
decimal significant figure was a zero. Once changing the byte code's values,
the numbers that printed out were the new byte code values; still
leaving the original values in the Java file.

I have verified that editing the byte code in Lab1Part4 has allowed the program
to run and produce the new results.

This lab posed to be challenging at first since it was something different than I had ever done. VNC viewer was a new way of looking at code and for the first half of the lab, it did not want to work for me. Thankfully, I figured it out and over time I got more comfortable with the idea of working in the VNC viewer. I am still getting use to the idea of Docker and being inside of a container to do all of my work. I hope over time that I am able to be fully confident and comfortable working with this new software.
